Predicting Baseball Salaries Using Big Data Tools

by: Jason, Shira, Julia, and Abby

Introduction
We are interested in the predictive power of MLB statistics. The MLB takes meticulous statistics
that measure players' performances per season; we wanted to use these numbers to predict player salaries
in future seasons. In our analysis, we will explore the relationship between hitting statistics and salary.
This analysis offers practical value to MLB franchises in providing a model for how much a player of any
given performance might or should earn. It also provides insight into which factors contribute most
significantly to determining salary level.

As mentioned, the variable we are predicting is salary (data from USA Today), and we are using
numerous hitting statistics provided by the MLB to predict it. We have chosen hitting statistics over
pitching statistics as every baseball player hits while only a select few pitch. Thus, we cover a
comprehensive range of baseball players in our data analysis.

We are training on data on statistics from the 2020-2024 seasons, and testing on statistics from the
2025 season. We will use the linear regression, KNN regression, and the random forest algorithm to
analyze the relationship between hitting statistics and salary. Linear regression provides a basic model for
analyzing relationships, while KNN regression offers a predictive model based on k-nearest neighbors.
Random forest furthers our examination by averaging out predictions from many different models in
order to improve our prediction accuracy.

Furthermore, we will conduct exploratory data analysis with K-Means analysis. K-Means analysis
will provide some insight into which factors contribute most significantly to determining salary level.
